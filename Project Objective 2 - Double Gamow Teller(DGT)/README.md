The problem of double beta decay is at present of mutual interest of both particle and nuclear physicists. The experimental study of double beta decay might provide an answer to wherter neutrio are Marjona or Fermi paritcle. The existence of neutrino less double beta decay will influence particle physicist understanding of weak interactions. Secondly the study of double beta decay is also important in the context of nuclear physics which can explain the structure of the nuclei.

## Double charge exchange excitations.
used to 
* DGTR - Double Gamow-Teller Giant Resonance
* To calculate Double beta decay matrix elements.


## performed by using
* pion beams

Through these expermental studies we observed
* Double isobaric analog states (DIAS)
* Dipole Giant resonance (GDR) built on IAS
* Double Dipole Resonance states.

DGTR might be obtaiend observed in the $^{24}Mg(^{18}O, ^{18}Ne) ^{24}Ne$ reaction. However no clear evidence of DGTR was found in these reactions. 

The sum rule for the single GT transistions is well known and proptional to the neutron excess
$$ S_- - S_+ = \sum_f \vert \langle f\vert O_-(GT)\vert i\rangle\vert^2 -  \vert \langle f\vert O_+(GT)\vert i\rangle\vert^2$$

$$ = 3(N-Z) \tag{1}$$

where the GT transistion operators reads as

$$  \hat O_{\pm} (GT) = \sum_{\alpha} \sigma(\alpha) t_{\pm}(\alpha) \tag{2}$$

The GT sum rule is model independent and gives a good guidance to perform the sinlge charge exchange reactions as (p,n) and ($^3$He,t) reactions to observe GTR strength in many nuclei. 
The DGT transistion operator $\hat O_{\pm}(GT)^2 $ can be projected to good multipole states to be 

$$ [\hat O_{\pm}(GT) \hat O_{\pm}(GT)]^J_\mu  $$ for $J = 0,2 \tag{3}$

The sum rule strength is defined as

$$ D_{\pm}^J = \sum_{J_f, M_f, \mu} \vert \langle J_f, M_f \vert[{\hat O_{\pm }}\times \hat O_{\pm}]^J_{\mu} \vert J_i, M_i\rangle \vert^2  \tag{4}$$

Where $J_i$ and $J_f$ are the angular momenta of the initial and final states. The sum rule strength is also expressed as reduced matrix elements

$$D_{\pm}^J = \frac{1}{2J_i + 1} \sum_{J_f} \vert \langle J_f \vert \vert [\hat O_{\pm} \times \hat O_{\pm}]^J \vert \vert J_i \rangle\vert^2 \tag{5} $$

where the double bar means the reduced matrix elements for the angular momentum.  Now we denote the inital state as

$$D_-^{(J=0)} - D_+^{(J=0)} = \langle i \vert \left[ \hat O_+ \times \hat O_+ \right]^{(J=0)}, \left[ \hat O_- \times \hat O_- \right]^{(J=0)}\vert i\rangle = 2(N-Z)(N-Z+1) + \frac{4}{3} \left[ (N-Z)S_+ - \langle i \vert [i\hat \Sigma \cdot (\hat O_- \times \hat O_+)+ \hat \Sigma \cdot \Sigma]\vert i \right]  \tag{6}$$

Where

$$\hat \Sigma = \sum_{\alpha} \sigma(\alpha)\tag{7}$$

and $(\hat O_-  \times \hat O _+ )$ is the vector product of two operators. 

in the last equation fo eq(6) we use an identity 
$$(\hat O_- \times \hat O_+) \cdot  \hat \Sigma = -\hat \Sigma \cdot (\hat O_- \times \hat O_+ ) + 2i \hat \Sigma \cdot  \hat \Sigma \tag{8}$$

which makes the final formula of the sum rule. It is important for quantitative study to rewrite the formula using eq(8) since the terms including $\hat O_+$ on the right can be omitted in $N \gt Z$ nuclei in the good accuracy. 
* The sum rule for $J^\pi = 2^+$ final states can be obtained in a similar way to that for $J = 0 $ states:
$$D_-^{(J=2)} - D_+^{(J=2)} = \langle i \vert \sum_\mu (-1)^\mu \left[ \hat O_+ \times \hat O_+ \right]^{(J=2)}, \left[ \hat O_- \times \hat O_- \right]^{(J=2)}\vert i\rangle = 10(N-Z)(N-Z-2) + \frac{10}{3} \left[ 2(N-Z)S_+ + \langle i \vert [i\hat \Sigma \cdot (\hat O_- \times \hat O_+)+ \hat \Sigma \cdot \Sigma]\vert i \right]  \tag{9}$$





## DGT transitition to the DIAS state.
* The DIAS state is defined as

$$ \vert DIAS \rangle = \frac{T_-T_-}{N_f} \vert i \rangle$$

Where $T_- \sum_\alpha = t_-(\alpha)$ is the isospin lowering operator and the normalization factor is $N_f = \sqrt{2(N-Z)(N-Z-1)}$. The double Fermi transition to DIAS state is evaluated to be:

$$\vert \langle DIAS \vert T_- T_- \vert i \rangle \vert^2 =  2(N-Z)(N-Z-1) \tag{11}$$


in which the mother state is assumed to have a good isospin quantum number $ T = T_z = (N-Z)/2$. The DGT transition to DIAS is also expressed as

$$ D_-^{(J=0)}(DIAS) = \left| \langle DIAS \vert [\hat O_- \times \hat O_-]^{(J=0)} \vert i\rangle\right|^2
$$

$$= \left| \frac{1}{N_f}\langle \hat O\vert T_+T_+ [\hat O_- \times \hat O_-]^{(J =0 )}\vert i \rangle\right|^2
$$

$$ = \frac{1}{3N_f^2}[8\Sigma_{sum} - 2(S_- + S_+)]^2
$$

$$ = \frac{1}{6(N-Z)(N-Z-1)}[8\Sigma_{sum} - 2(S_- + S_+)]^2 \tag{12}$$

where $\Sigma_{sum}$ is the sum rule of the isovector spin transition

$$ \Sigma_{sum} = \langle i\vert \sum_{\alpha, \mu} \sigma_{\mu}(\alpha)t_z(\alpha) \sum_{\beta, \mu'} \sigma_{\mu'}(\beta) t_z(\beta)\vert i \rangle \tag{13}
$$

For a single j-configuration  with the occupation probability $v^2$, the value $\Sigma_{sum}$ is evaluated as

$$
\Sigma_{sum} = \sum_{p,h,\mu} \vert \langle (ph) 1\mu \vert \sigma_\mu t_z \vert \hat 0 \rangle \vert^2 \tag{14}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{4} \frac{v_h^2(2j_h + 1)(2j_h - 1)}{j_h} 
$$

for $j_h = j_p + 1$
