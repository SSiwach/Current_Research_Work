NuShellX is set of wrapper codes for carrying out shell-model calculations with dimensions up to 10^9. The main code was written by W. D. M. Rae. The calculations is carried 
out in a specific model space and Hamiltonian. There are two formalism for a model namely in proton-neutron (pn) and isospin (iso). Crossponding hamiltonian can used in isospin
or proton-neutron formalism.
