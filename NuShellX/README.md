NuShellX is set of wrapper codes for carrying out shell-model calculations with dimensions up to 10^9. The main code was written by W. D. M. Rae. The calculations is carried 
out in a specific model space and Hamiltonian. There are two formalism for a model namely in proton-neutron (pn) and isospin (iso). Crossponding hamiltonian can used in isospin
or proton-neutron formalism. 

It is written in Fortran 95 and some Fortran 2003 additions an uses Intel Fortran Compiler. Nushell is still limited by the fact that it has to store a large number of Hamiltonian matrix.
